			prepare environment -->  create React app --> push to Amplify --> create Cognito --> install Amplify library --> run the App --> add function to the quiz --> 

			push vs code to GitHub --> hook Amplify to grab code from GitHub --> create role


**I am not able to use nodejs and npm in my vs code at the first place, finally find that the terminal use powershell cause the problem, use command prompt is ok**

---------------------------------------------------------------

1) prepare enviornment: 
				node.js + aws amplify cli
								> npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
								> amplify configure
												IAM --> create user --> create access key
								
2) create React app:
				> npx create-react-app cloudproject03
							**if you occur error in npm, use > npm install --legacy-peerpdeps
				> cd .\cloudprojetct03\
				> amplify init
				
				goto AWS conosle, in Amplify, the cloudproject03 should be created (in this stage it is still a empty container without authenication, api, database etc)
				
3) create Cognito:
				> amplify add auth
									Q1-use default authenication?
									- Default configuration (=cognito)
									- Default configuration with social provider (=facebook or google)
									- Manual configuration 
									
									Q2-how to sign in?
									- Email
				
				> amplify push (push all config to aws)
				
		3.1 	goto AWS cognito, you will find the "cloudproject03" was created
				click the project name, at the left panel, click "user", we will create a user later
		
		3.2 	copy code for "App.js" file
				
		3.3	install "amplify library" to give use the user login interface: 
				> npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
							**if any error, use > npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react --legacy-peer-deps
							
		3.4	run the app
				> npm start (this will open a browser will user log-in page)
				
				create a account with real e-mail address

		3.5	goback to Cognito user, you will find a user information was added 
		
		
4) add function and styling for the quiz:

		in vs code, add 2 file under "src" folder, name - Quiz.js & quizData.js, copy the code from github and make some code adjustment
		once done, save file, and you will find the user login page is updated, there are questions now.
		
5) push vs code to GitHub: 

		goto github and create a repository
		goto vs code, input below in terminal:
						
						https://github.com/carichung/CloudProject03-aws_cognito_amplify_reactapp
						
						> git init
						> git add .
						> git commit -m "Initial commit"
										**if author unknown error occur, input your github user name and e-mail for vs code linkup to your github, instruction is given
											> git config --global --list (= to check the user info you just input)
						> git branch -M main
						> git remote add origin https://github.com/carichung/CloudProject03-aws_cognito_amplify_reactapp.git
						> git push -u origin main
										**if there are error, use > git push  --force origin main
										
		goto Github, you should find the vs code coding is in your repository now
		
		
6) hook up with Amplify and setup CI/CD:

				goto aws Amplify, in "Hosting environments",  choose "GitHub" (=this is just asking where are your frontend file?)
				in "recently updated repository", if you cannot find your repository, this maybe a permission problem, click "View GitHub permission" and you will redirect to GitHub,
				in "repository access", choose "only select repository"  and select the repository you want to link up with Amplify
				now go back to Amplify, you should able to choose the repository.
				
				for "Branch" choose "main"
				in "build setting" , choose the backend environment to use this branch
				enable the "full stack CI/CD"
				
				create new role:
						choose "AWS service", other options keep as default, click "create role"
						select the role you just create
				
				review all details, click "save and deploy"
				
				the process should be success.
				
				open the link Amplify provide, you should able to log-in and play the quiz
